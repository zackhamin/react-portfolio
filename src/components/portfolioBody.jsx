          Hello.
          <br />
          Thanks for checking me out.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can learn more about me in the tabs to the left. I find one of the
          best ways to learn, is to build. <br />
          Hence, I put this site together.
          <br />
          It's a work in progress.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }

export default PortfolioHomebody;
