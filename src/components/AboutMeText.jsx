        I am a dedicated and ambitious junior developer, eager to learn and
        already making an impact! <br />
        <br />
        After teaching myself how to code, almost a year and a half ago, I have
        gone from strength to strength in the industry, building a network of
        aspiring career changers, junior and senior developers as well as
        organisers, projects managers and more along the way.
        <br />
        <br />I am a STEM ambassador, GDG Manchester founder and lead as well as
        being an active member of a task force aimed at tackling diversity and
        inclusion in Manchesters growing and vibrant tech scene.
        <br />
        <br />I am passionate about learning new technologies, I currently work
        as a junior full stack software engineer using React, Node, JS, Docker
        and cloud technologies. I have also worked with Kotlin and Swift as a
        mobile app dev for the Co-op bank.
        <br />
        <br />I love the software engineering community, I love learning and
        giving back by mentoring and offering advice to career changers. As a
        part of my GDG Group I host meet-ups, Hackathons and online workshops.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I am not coding, I am enjoying lifes little pleasures. Me and my
        family are big fans of hiking, we have a few camping trips booked for
        2021, Spending time with my kids helps me appreciate how far I have come
        in this industry in a relatively short time.
